This our team's code for the 2024 Submerged season. 

The team got 345 in the competition out of a possible 355.

The code implemented a number of other missions but we simply ran out of time to execute them during the competition.

They used created and used the Gen3_Robot_Front_Top_Attach_rev18.io with a number of attachments. 

We are still converting the attachments to drawings in BrinkLink Studio.
