This repository is a set of Python scripts, Lego models (Bricklink Studio), Lego Spike Prime Python examples, Pybricks examples including a Robot Library, and a Python course we created to our school's First Lego League team.

All the non-Lego Python examples were created in Visual Studio Code.

The Lego Models were created using Bricklink Studio

The Lego Python examples were created in Lego Spike Prime 3.6 and higher.

I strongly recommend any First Lego League (FLL) team that wants to develop in Python use Pybricks instead of LEGO's Spike Prime version.
