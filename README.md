This repository is a set of Python scripts, Lego models (Bricklink Studio), Lego Spike Prime Python examples, and a Python course I created to support efforts my son's First Lego League team.

All the non-Lego Python examples were created in Visual Studio Code for Mac.

The Lego Models were created using Bricklink Studio for Mac.

The Lego Python examples were created in Lego Spike Prime 3.4.3.
